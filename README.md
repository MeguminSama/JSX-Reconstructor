# JSX Reconstructor

This project was made with the intention of turning compiled React code back into JSX.
Tested with pre and post-SWC Discord builds and React Native builds.

## Caution!

This code is extremely shit and WIP. Please do give it a try and create an issue if you find any problems! Please provide some example code that I can work with to diagnose the issue. Thanks :)

## Usage

1. `npm install`
2. Create a folder called `input` and place your `.js` files in there.
3. Run `npm run start`
